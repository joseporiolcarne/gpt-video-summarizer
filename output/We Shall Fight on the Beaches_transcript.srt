00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
When a week ago today, Mr. Speaker, I asked the House to fix this afternoon as the occasion

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:18,840
for a statement, I feared it would be my hard lot to announce the greatest military disaster

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:28,360
in our long history. I thought, and some good judges agreed with me, that perhaps 20,000

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,439
or 30,000 men might be re-embarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the French

5
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:45,680
First Army and the whole of the British Expeditionary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would

6
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,959
be broken up in the open field, or else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammunition.

7
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:59,919
These were the hard and heavy tidings for which I called upon the House and the nation

8
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:09,360
to prepare themselves a week ago. The whole root and core and brain of the British Army,

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:17,000
on which and around which we were to build and are to build, the great British armies

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,879
in the later years of the war seemed about to perish upon the field or be led into an

11
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:32,519
ignominious and starving captivity. The enemy attacked us on all sides with great strength

12
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:40,120
and fierceness. And their main power, the power of their far more numerous air force,

13
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:48,919
was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk and the beaches. Pressing in upon

14
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:56,040
the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy began to fire with cannon

15
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,440
upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart. They sowed magnetic

16
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:09,919
mines in the channels and seas. They sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft, sometimes more than a

17
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,679
hundred strong in one formation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that remained

18
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:25,720
and upon the sand dunes on which the troops had their only shelter. Their U-boats, one

19
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:33,119
of which was sunk, and their motor launchers took the toll of the vast traffic which now

20
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:40,119
began. For four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their armoured divisions, or

21
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:45,800
what was left of them, together with great masses of infantry and artillery, hurled themselves

22
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:54,000
in vain upon the ever-narrowing, ever-contracting appendix within which the British and French

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
armies fought. Meanwhile the Royal Navy, with the willing help of countless merchant seamen,

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,639
strained every nerve to embark the British and Allied troops. Two hundred and twenty

25
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:16,119
light warships and six hundred and fifty other vessels were engaged. They had to operate

26
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:22,600
upon the difficult coast, and often in adverse weather, under an almost ceaseless hail of

27
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:31,600
bombs and an increasing concentration of artillery fire. Nor were the seas, as I have said, themselves

28
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,160
free from mines and torpedoes. It was in conditions such as these that our men carried

29
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:46,479
on with little or no rest, for days and nights on end, making trip after trip across the

30
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:54,479
dangerous waters, bringing with them, always, men whom they had rescued. The numbers they

31
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:01,320
have brought back are the measure of their devotion and their courage. The hospital ships

32
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,800
which brought off many thousands of British and French wounded, being so plainly marked,

33
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,600
were a special target for Nazi bombs, but the men and women on board them never faltered

34
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:21,279
in their duty. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already been intervening in the

35
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:29,040
battle, so far as its range would allow, from our home bases, now used part of its

36
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:37,839
main metropolitan fighter strength and struck at the German bombers and at the fighters,

37
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:46,040
which in large numbers protected them. This struggle was protracted and fierce. Suddenly

38
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:53,799
the scene had cleared. The crash and thunder, as for the moment, but only for the moment,

39
00:04:53,799 --> 00:05:03,920
died away. A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valour, by perseverance, by perfect discipline,

40
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:12,399
by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable fidelity, is manifest to

41
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:22,239
us all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreating British troops. They were so roughly

42
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:31,600
handled that he did not carry their departure seriously. Sir, we must be very careful not to

43
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,239
assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations,

44
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:47,239
but there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted. It was gained by the Air

45
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:55,440
Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at work. They saw only the

46
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,799
bombers, which escaped its protective attack. They underrated its achievements. I've heard

47
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:10,440
much talk of this, and that is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it.

48
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:18,440
This was a great trial of strength between the British and German air forces. Can you conceive

49
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:26,480
a greater objective for the Germans in the air than to make evacuation from these beaches

50
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:33,600
impossible, and to sink all these ships, which were displayed almost to the extent of thousands?

51
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,519
Could there have been an objective of greater military importance and significance for the

52
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:48,239
whole purpose of the wars of this? They tried hard, and they were beaten back. They were frustrated in

53
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:57,959
their task. We got the army away, and they have paid fourfold for any losses which they have

54
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:06,239
inflicted. Sir, when we consider how much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above

55
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:13,200
this island against an overseas attack, I must say that I find in these facts a sure basis upon

56
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:22,119
which practical and reassuring thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young airmen. The

57
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:32,279
great French army was very largely, for the time being, cast back and disturbed by the onrush of

58
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:41,440
a few thousands of armored vehicles. May it not also be that the cause of civilization itself

59
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:51,239
will be defended by the skill and devotion of a few thousand airmen. There never has been, I suppose,

60
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:59,279
in all the world, in all the history of war, such an opportunity for use. The Knights of the Round

61
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:11,160
Table, the Crusaders, all fall back into the past, not only distant, but prosaic. These young men

62
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,880
going forth every morn to guard their native land and all that we stand for, holding in their hands

63
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:26,480
these instruments of colossal and shattering power, of whom it may be said that every morn brought

64
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:35,679
forth a noble chance, and every chance brought forth a noble knight, deserve our gratitude. Yes,

65
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:45,440
all the brave men, in so many ways and on so many occasions, are ready and continue ready to give

66
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:56,039
life and all for their native land. Nevertheless, our thankfulness at the escape of our army and so

67
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:03,200
many men whose loved ones have passed through an agonizing week does not blind us to the fact that

68
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:11,960
what happened in France and Belgium, it's a colossal military disaster. The French army has

69
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:18,919
been weakened, the Belgian army has been lost, a large part of those fortified lines upon which

70
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:25,880
so much faith has been reposed, is gone. Many valuable mining districts and factories have

71
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:33,280
passed into the enemy's possession, the whole of the Channel ports are in its hands, with all the

72
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,880
tragic consequences that follow from that, and we must expect another blow to be struck almost

73
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:50,000
immediately at us or at France. We are told, sir, that Herr Hitler has a plan for invading the British

74
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,840
Isles. This has often been thought of before. When Napoleon laid boulogne for a year with his

75
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:06,960
flat-bottomed boats and his grand army, he was told by someone, there are bitter weeds in England.

76
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:14,000
There are certainly a great many more of them since the British expeditionary force returned.

77
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,080
Sir, I have myself full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the

78
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:29,400
best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once more able to defend

79
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:38,039
our island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary,

80
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:48,039
for years, if necessary, alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the

81
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:54,679
resolve of His Majesty's government, every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation.

82
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:01,799
The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will

83
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:07,799
defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their

84
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:17,000
strength. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France. We shall fight on the seas and oceans.

85
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,840
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air. We shall defend our island,

86
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:31,960
whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds.

87
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:40,039
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender.

88
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:48,679
And if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and

89
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:57,799
starving, then our empire, beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British fleet, would carry on

90
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:06,440
the struggle until, in God's good time, the new world, with all its power and might, steps forth to the

91
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,280
rescue and the liberation of the old.
